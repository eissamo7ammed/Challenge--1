## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Concepts Learned

During this build, I focused on the following core concepts:

* **Semantic HTML5:** Structuring content logically.
* **CSS Box Model:** Understanding padding, margins, and borders.
* **Flexbox:** Used for aligning the price and descriptions efficiently.
* **Typography:** Creating visual hierarchy (Headings vs. Body text).
* **Button Styling:** Creating interactive call-to-action buttons.

## 🔮 Future Improvements (The Roadmap)

As I move towards Backend development, I plan to upgrade this project by:
- [ ] Adding JavaScript to make the "Go to Course" button interactive.
- [ ] Connecting this card to a **Database** to fetch course details dynamically.
- [ ] Creating a backend API using **Node.js/Python**.
